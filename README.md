# Polynomial

## Description
Polynomial is a library for dealing with polynomials.

## Getting Started
You can initialize polynomials with an array or hash. The polynomial <tt>3x^2 + 1</tt> could be initialized with `Polynomial.new([1,0,3])` or directly with `Polynomial.new({0 => 1, 2 => 3})`.

The coefficients are accessible through the `Polynomial#coefficients` method. It will return a hash of non zero coefficients. Single coefficients are accessible via `Polynomial#[]`.

    p = Polynomial.new({0 => 1, 2 => 3})
    
    p.coefficients # => {0 => 1, 2 => 3}
    
    p[0] # => 1
    p[36] # => 0
